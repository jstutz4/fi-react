How can you know if the choices you are making are good and leading you to the future you will enjoy? Values, knowing what your values are and what they mean to you gives you a standard to move towards and a way to make informed judgments on your choices. It is okay if your values change over time, in fact I think we should strive to refine our values throughout our lives.","This is your foundation your values and your why.

When we have taken control of our lifestyle and have money in our hands instead of the hands of consumer debt we have choices. We should have a small buffer maybe one or two months of expenses in our accounts and maybe in a high yield savings account that will keep up with inflation 2-3% APR. Continue to grow your savings or emergency fund till you feel safe and protected (you wouldn't be feeling fear controlling you) if you were to loose your job today. For most people that looks like have 6-12 months of expenses, others it may be only 1-3 months of expenses.","If you are like me and that feel like its not the best to be holding onto 20-50K in emergency fund in bank accounts, well you do have other options. I would encourage you to diversify your savings especially as you feel more confident in you and your families ability to receive an income even after a job loss, to begin to put money towards investing like bonds, treasuries, gold, and stock market index funds.

When considering the future a couple hundred or thousand dollar investment to learn new skills, or a degree or certificate if the return is high even for it to make sense to you.

With a mindset of investing for the future short-term gains don't matter. This is why when the market drops we don't care because we know it is going to go back up, and we can wait. The most important key to investing is to understand why you invest in what you investing in, make a plan, execute the plan, and stick to your plan.
